/*
 * Write the following program:
 *
 * Create a struct that holds a student's first name and grade (on a scale
 * of 0-100).
 *
 * Ask the user how many students they want to enter. Create a std::vector to
 * hold all of the sutdents. Then prompt the user for each name and grade.
 *
 * Once the user has entered all the names and grade pairs sort the list by
 * grade (highest first).
 *
 * Then print all the names and grades in sorted order.
 *
 * For the following input:
 *
 * 	Joe
 * 	82
 * 	Terry
 * 	73
 * 	Ralph
 * 	4
 * 	Alex
 * 	94
 * 	Mark
 * 	88
 *
 * The output should look like this:
 * 
 * 	Alex got a grade of 94
 * 	Mark got a grade of 88
 * 	Joe got a grade of 82
 * 	Terry got a grade of 73
 * 	Ralph got a grade of 4
 *
 * You can assume that names don't contain spaces and that input extraction doesn't fail.
