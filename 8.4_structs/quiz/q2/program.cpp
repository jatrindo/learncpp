/*
 * Create a struct to hold a fraction.
 *
 * The struct should have an integer numerator and an integer denominator
 * member. Declare 2 fraction variables and read them in from the user. 
 *
 * Write a function called multiply that takes both fractions, multiplies
 * them together, and returns the result as a decimal number. You do not need
 * to reduce the fraction to its lowest terms.
 *
 * Print the result of the multiplication of the 2 fraction variables.
