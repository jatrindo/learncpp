/*
 * Unoptimized bubble sort performs the following steps to sort an array
 * from smallest to largest:
 *
 * A) Compare array element 0 with array element 1. If element 0 is larger,
 * swap it with element 1.
 * B) Now do the same for elements 1 and 2, and every subsequent pair of
 * elements until you hit the end of the array. At this point the last
 * element in the array will be sorted.
 * C) Repeat the first two steps again until the array is sorted.
 *
 * Write code that bubble sorts the following array according to the rules
 * above:
 *
 * 	int array[]{ 6, 3, 2, 9, 7, 1, 5, 4, 8 };
 *
 * Print the sorted array elements at the end of your program.
