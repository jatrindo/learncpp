/*
 * Write a Fraction class that has a constructor that takes a numerator and a
 * denominator.
 *
 * If the user passes in a denominator of 0, throw an exception of type
 * std::runtime_error (included in the stdexcept header).
 *
 * In your main program, ask the user to enter two integers. If the Fraction is
 * valid, print the fraction. If the Fraction is invalid, catch a
 * std::exception, and tell the user that they entered an invalid fraction.
 *
 * Hereś what one run of the program should output:
 * 
 *  Enter the numerator: 5
 *  Enter the deonminator: 0
 *  Invalid denominator
