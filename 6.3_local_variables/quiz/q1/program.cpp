/*
 * Write a program that asks the user to enter two integers, one named
 * 'smaller', the other named 'larger'
 *
 * If the user enters a smaller value for the second integer, use a block
 * and temporary variable to swap the smaller and larger values (so that
 * smaller value is in 'smaller' and the larger value in 'larger')
 *
 * Then print the values of the 'smaller' and 'larger' variables.
 *
 * Add comments to your code indicating where each variable dies
